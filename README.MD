POKEDEX APPl

-Created array (pokemonList) with 5 objects, (each object includes: name,height, and styles.

-Created for loop to display names and height of pokemon.  
-Added condition to for loop to display "wow that's big" on the tallest pokemon.

- Created IIFE and put PokemonList array inside of IIFE to secure code. Also assigned variable- pokemonrepository to IIFE to allow outside functions to call it.
- Replaced for Loop w/ a forEach Loop.
- Updated forEach Loop to allow the loop to retrieve data from inside the IIFE repository.
